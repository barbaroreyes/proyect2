# Project Retrospective

Letâ€™s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below. This will give perspective for yourself, for your classmates and for the next cohort taking this course. It's important to be honest, and recognize that you are all learning, and making similar if not the same mistakes.
