# Asking For Help

## During Normal Weeks

Please make sure to read the [One on Ones guidelines](one-on-ones.md)!

Outside of One on Ones, you can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. Slack is the most effective way to communicate with instructors.

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions...

1. Try something else
2. Google your exact problem or error
3. Reference the appropriate lesson plan
4. Ask another classmate
5. Ask an instructor

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- please reach out directly to an instructor as soon as possible.

**After 6pm**, aside from during [office hours](office-hours.md), instructors may not be able to respond to technical questions until the following morning.

## During Project Weeks

### Issues

Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

#### Context

When requesting assistance with an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What user story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried

Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
