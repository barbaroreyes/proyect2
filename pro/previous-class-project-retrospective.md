# Project Retrospective

Letâ€™s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below.  One of the instructional team will go through each category and capture as many thoughts as possible.  We ask that you come off mute and speak your thoughts out loud for everyone to hear. 

## Lessons Learned

What lessons did you learn during this project and how will you apply them towards the next project? 

- budget time to become fluent in your api
- deploying a react app is hard
- console.log everything when you can
- peel back the data structure of the api to get only the data you need
- when you create something push it to github
- when you  get stuck take some time to refresh (meditate, sleep, w/e)
- make use of different branches
- always have a backup plan in relation to your original idea

## Problem Areas

What areas of the project did you struggle with most?

- APIs / figuring out the data structure
- Deploying website on netlify , be familiar with other deployment methods
- Netlify - had to change the build commands in package.json CI=false npm run build
- Netlify - nesting folder as sub directory
- SPA apps need to have a redirect to the index.html (in React)
- On Netlify: security issues with <a target="_blank">
- Check what your array methods are returning. Don't get too caught up the meta logic, check each step of the way 
- Review how Classes work with State, to better understand Hooks
- How to push changes to a deployed 

## Future Directions

What plans do you have in the future for this project? Are there any PostMVP's that you are looking to implement and what are they? 

- Make code more succinct - less hard coded
- implement firebase
- Add more data to app via api and manipulate the data based off of user needs
- add some autocomplete to search functionality
- figure out how to make loading icons or animations while data is being retrieved
- get good at adding more style to the website that changes dynamically 
- codify learning into an article to articulate what you have learned
